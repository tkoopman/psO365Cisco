# psO365Cisco

While no one wants to manually maintain static routes to O365, I have a need to for a period of time until the proper solution can be implemented.

To that end I created this module to help maintain these routes with the Microsoft XML file.

Incase anyone else is forced to go this path I thought I would publish it here.
